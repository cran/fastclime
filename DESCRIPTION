Description: Provides a method of recovering the precision matrix efficiently 
        and solving for the dantzig selector by applying the parametric 
        simplex method.  The computation is based on a linear optimization
        solver. It also contains a generic LP solver and a parameterized LP 
        solver using parametric simplex method.
